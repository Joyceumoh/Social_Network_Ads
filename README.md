**Questions Covered**..

•	Is there a correlation between age and the likelihood of making a purchase?                                                                                                                                                 
•	Is there a correlation between estimated salary and the likelihood of making a purchase?                                                                                                                                    
•	How does the distribution of estimated salary differ between those who made a purchase and those who did not?                                                                                                               
•	Are there any outliers in the dataset, and how do they affect the analysis?                                                                                                                                                 
•	Which features (age, estimated salary, etc.) have the most significant impact on purchase decisions?                                                                                                                        

**Conclusions**                                                                                                                                                                                                               
In summary, Age shows the strongest correlation with purchase, followed by estimated salary. It also shows that persons between the age range of 27 years and above earn more salaries and purchased more while persons below 26 years old earn less salaries and purchased less. This means that those who purchased the ads are older than those who did not purchase. Also, those who purchased earn more salary than those who did not purchase, indicating the impact of age and salary on purchase of the ads.
These findings can serve as a guide on the ages and estimated salaries of persons to put into consideration when creating the social networks in order to boost sales performance.
